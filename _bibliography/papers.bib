abstract = {The hydraulic verification of combined sewer systems as well as the assessment of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) can be conducted using a hydrodynamic model. Unfortunately, long-term simulations with hydrodynamic models for the assessment of CSOs can cause unacceptably long computation times. Using only a series of storm events instead of a precipitation continuum can reduce this time and enables parallel simulation of single storm events. We introduce a method to select this series of storm events. The method's parameters have been optimized to replicate the overflow volume of the continuous simulation and to minimize the overall computation time. This optimization revealed a generally applicable parameter set that results in series of storm events that are shorter than the precipitation continuum by 86.2–95.2{\%} for the investigated cases. Additionally, the deviation of overflow volume between continuous simulation and series simulation ranges between only 0.1{\%} and 4.1{\%}.},

Smart water networks based on wireless sensors offer a huge potential in this domain, but their deployment and maintenance is often costly and labor-intensive. In this paper, we present Adige: an efficient smart water network architecture based on long-range wireless technology that improves the scalability and robustness of water distribution systems. We developed a sensor node prototype using a LoRa radio transceiver and used it to carry out a set of experiments showing the benefits of Adige's approach. Our evaluation shows that, in contrast to previous approaches, the use of long-range wireless technology allows to significantly reduce energy consumption while covering large areas indoors, outdoors, and underground.},

The targets of these comparisons were a) to see how robust sensor positions are in terms of different mathematical approaches b) to derive the optimal sensor placement for the purpose of small leakage localisation in a case study distribution system. Therefore, we created artificial leakage scenarios in the real world system by opening fire hydrants at different flow rates. Pressure was measured at all hydrants that were found to be an ideal sensor position by any of the applied methods. Based on these measurements, model-based leakage localization was run using data from the different sensor sets. To compare leakage localization performance the distance between the found to the real world leak was calculated. The results of the sensor placement have shown similarities in sensor positions for graph theory based methods, but the ideal sensor positions derived from the sensitivity based methods varied strongly. The localisation results have shown that leaks down to 0.5 l/s can be located but for different leak positions different sensor sets, mainly those with sensors close to the leak position, led to the best performance.},

abstract = {While background leakages accounting for substantial water losses in supply networks remain unde- tectable, human reaction to even visible pipe bursts is insufficiently slow. We lose precious time in which not only water losses but severe damage to the surrounding infrastructure could be prevented. These leakages can often be identified only during the minimum night flow and so repair work is delayed by days, causing intermittent water supply and outages. Increasing costs and the importance to ensure supply security require further measures. Therefore, the application of holistic algorithms controlling proportional valves and pumps allows to act instantaneously on failures by isolating affected pipe sections and by reducing the pressure in that region. With the target to apply classical control theory and yet avoid too complex formulations, this paper presents a dynamic model using no more parameters than a typical, steady-state EPANET model. By means of a sophisticated network description, we modify the rigid water column theory in terms of pressure-driven demands. Other than traditional methods, this approach enables nodal consumptions to dynamically change inner system states such as pressure or flow values. Within this method, the nodal elevation undergoes proper treatment in the model equations and further ensures that pressure values will not become negative as one may have experienced in EPANET.},

Therefore, the crack type specific relationship between leakage outflow and pressure is of interest. Recent findings offer new opportunities for burst outflow calculations with hydraulic models. In this paper, we compare two calculation approaches according to uncertainties caused by input parameters and give recommendations for the applicability of the methods. Simulations in a case study area have shown large leakage outflow differences between the two approaches for longitudinal cracks. For circumferential cracks, the differences are smaller. Further, due to the uncertain leak size and form of probable bursts we involved Monte Carlo simulations in the model approach. These allow the derivation of mean values and standard deviations of leakage outflow per pipe section to make the uncertainty of the results more transparent.},

abstract = {Often, two different models are provided for the same sewer system, namely a hydrodynamic model for the hydraulic verification and a conceptual model for the verification of compliance with standards for combined sewer overflows (CSO). However, a combined verification using only one model has many advantages. For the necessary calculation of water levels for the hydraulic verification, only hydrodynamic models are applicable. Consequently, a hydrodynamic model has to be used for a combined verification if the same model should be used for both applications. Often, the verification and assessment of CSOs asks for long-term simulation. The use of hydrodynamic models in combination with continuous simulation of a couple of years up to several decades regularly leads to unacceptable high computation times. As an alternative, a series of rainfall events can be used for the simulations instead of the precipitation continuum leading to dramatically reduced computational times. This paper introduces a method to generate such a series of rainfall events. This series is optimized to match the overflow volumes of the continuous simulation and to reduce the overall computation time of the series simulation.},

abstract = {Losses in water distribution systems can be between several percent in well maintained systems up to more than 50 percent in developing countries. Most of the losses originate from leaks. Therefore, a fast detection and localization of leaks is crucial for effectively reducing this losses in water distribution networks. Model-based leak localization has become increasingly popular in recent years. Certainly, the performance of these methods is linked to 1) the measurement locations in the system and 2) uncertainties at these locations. This paper provides a methodology that incorporates uncertainties of different types and sources in the optimal sensor placement problem for leak localization shown by the example of the effect of demand uncertainties on potential pressure measurement points. The problem is solved for different numbers of sensors and different strengths of uncertainties are taken into account. Additionally, to describe the relation between the number of sensors and the leak localization quality, a cost-benefit function is derived based on the different sensor placement results and GoF statistics. It was found that the function follows a power law. Results show that incorporating uncertainties leads to other optimal positions than without uncertainties, but the power law behavior still stays true. Additionally, more sensors are needed than without uncertainties.},

abstract = {Exchange of scientific data and metadata between single users or organizations is a challenging task due to differences in data formats, the genesis of data collection, ontologies and prior knowledge of the users. Different data storage requirements, mostly defined by the structure, size and access scenarios, require also different data storage solutions, since there is no and there cannot be a data format which is suitable for all tasks and needs that occur especially in a scientific workflow. Besides data, the generation and handling of additional corresponding metadata leads us to the additional challenge of defining the "meaning" of data, which should be formulated in a way that it can be commonly understood to get out a maximum of expected and shareable information of the observed processes. In our domain we are able to take advantage of standards defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium, namely the standards defined by the Sensor Web Enablement, WaterML and CF-NetCDF working groups. Even though these standards are freely available and some of them are commonly used in specialized software packages, the adaption in widespread end-user software solutions still seems to be in its beginnings. This contribution describes a software solution developed at Graz University of Technology, which targets the storage and exchange of measurement data with a special focus on meteorological, water quantity and water quality observation data collected within the last three decades. The solution was planned on basis of long-term experience in sewer monitoring and was built on top of open-source software only. It allows high-performance storage of time series and associated metadata, access-controlled web services for programmatic access, validation tasks, event detection, automated alerting and notification. An additional web-based graphical user interface was created which gives full control to end-users. The OpenSDM software approach makes it easier for measurement station operators, maintainers and end-users to take advantage of the standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium, which usage should be promoted in the water related communities.},

abstract = {The calculation of leakage outflow is of interest for several tasks in water distribution system analysis, e.g., investigation of pipe burst consequences, efficiency estimations of pressure management, or model-based leakage localization. Several studies on pressure-leakage dependencies have shown that this dependency can be much higher than defined with the orifice equation of Torricelli. The findings of these studies differ significantly, even for the same pipe material, failure modes, and sizes. In this paper, we describe the influence of uncertainties on assumptions of emitter exponents and crack areas on discharge rates for different failure modes. An approach for modeling elastically deforming leaks in water distribution pipes was implemented into systematic discharge rate calculations with EPANET2 by the means of an iterative estimation of the emitter exponent. For a partial pipe network of the city of Vienna, the results of the original EPANET2 and the extended emitter approach were compared. The largest differences in leakage outflow and hence in the amount of pipes with potential high failure consequences were found for longitudinal cracks. For this failure mode material, crack size and dimensions have a significant influence on the emitter exponent. Consequently, it is recommended for systematic discharge rate calculations to gather historic data about typical failure modes and failure dimensions of the investigated system. Further, if failure modes with a high sensitivity on the emitter exponent (like longitudinal crack or spiral crack) are relevant for the investigated system, a detailed calculation of the discharge rate is suggested.},

Examples can be found in online condition monitoring, real time control applications, or model based leakage detection and location approaches, etc. All these techniques require extensive hydraulic simulations. Well known and trusted hydraulic simulation tools like EPANET, etc. are deployed within the individual task specific code using provided interface routines. The flow dependent friction models of hydraulic systems require an iterative solution strategy to solve the problem. Although this is done efficiently using Newton-Raphson methods, the simulation output provided by those tools is limited to raw information (i.e. flow and head). Yet the superior algorithms often require more information than the raw output. I.e. gradient based optimization methods rely on derivative information. In this paper we report on a hydraulic small signal model which can be directly derived from the output of the hydraulic simulation tool itself. The model provides cheap computational access to internal information like gradients, sensitivity, etc. of the hydraulic simulation. The ATCA equilibrium structure of the model is numerically suitable and provides properties like a positive definite stiffness matrix enabling the efficient use of direct solvers like Cholesky decomposition. Further, the symmetry provides the property of self adjointness which enables the efficient use of Greens functions. We will present how the model can be assembled from the raw simulator output and present how to use it as linear approximation, for the computation of search directions in gradient based optimization schemes, for sensitivity analysis, as well as for the computation of covariance propagation due to uncertain demands.},

abstract = {Leakages in water distribution systems (WDS) can cause significant economic losses. Therefore finding leaks in water pipes is a crucial task for water utilities. In this paper, the effects of leakages on the hydraulics of WDS, particularly with regard to flow and pressure, are investigated. From the discrepancy of the unperturbed and the perturbed WDS due to the occurrence of leakage a methodology is developed, which enables an efficient sensor placement of flow meters and pressure sensors. This is achieved by a fault sensitivity matrix (FSM). A special genetic Algorithm (GA) called differential evolution (DE), which saves significantly on computation time in large WDS, is used to find the optimal position of a minimum number of sensors. DE is chosen because of its good rate of convergence. Once an optimal sensor placement is obtained, DE is also used for leakage location. The methodology was tested in two different WDS. The first WDS is the model network Poulakis (2003) used. The second is a partial network in the city of Linz, where the task is to find an ideal sensor placement to guarantee efficient leakage isolation. In this paper we show that DE performs excellently on both tasks, the sensor placement and the leakage isolation, for the two investigated systems. Additionally the implementation of demand and measurement uncertainties is outlined.},

abstract = {Leakages in water distribution systems (WDS) can lead to supply interruptions, contaminations and economic losses. Hence finding leaks before they cause severe problems is a crucial task for water utilities. To identify the existence of leaks, night flow measurements in district-metered areas (DMA) are common practice. Therefore, the entire system has to be subdivided in hydraulically separated partial networks. However, many utilities do not want to lose the hydraulic redundancy of their system and hence search for other solutions to identify and allocate leaks. In our research, the effects of leakages on the hydraulic behaviour of WDS are utilized to find the optimal solution for placing hydraulic sensors. From the discrepancy of the unperturbed and the perturbed WDS due to the occurrence of leakage, a methodology is developed which enables an efficient placement of flow meters and pressure sensors. This is achieved by a Fault Sensitivity Matrix (FSM). Finding the optimal position of a minimum number of sensors is carried out by a specific Genetic Algorithm called Differential Evolution (DE). DE is chosen due to its good rate of convergence reducing the computation time. This is of special interest for large WDS. Once an optimal sensor placement is obtained, DE is also used for leakage localization. The methodology has been applied and tested in two different WDS. The first WDS was a model network published by Poulakis in 2003. The second was a partial network of an Austrian city. Here the task was to place as few sensors as possible concerning economical costs while guaranteeing leakage localization in an area of a predefined size. In this paper it is shown that DE performs well, both on sensor placement and leakage localization, for both investigated systems. Additionally the implementation of demand and measurement uncertainties is outlined.},

abstract = {Detecting and locating leaks in water distribution systems is of great interest. For the localization of leaks we make use of pressure sensors alongside a calibrated hydraulic EPANET model of the investigated system. Leakage localization is solved with a Differential Evolution algorithm. For sensor placement we use a non-binarized leak sensitivity matrix with a projection-based leak isolation approach. Additionally, the effect of uncertain hydraulic model parameters on the measurement quantities is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations and was incorporated in the sensor placement algorithm. Uncertainty analysis, sensor placement and leakage location was tested on two hydraulic systems.},

abstract = {Storing scientific data is challenging due to the nature of scientific workflows and data are of limited usefulness if they are not stored in an organised manner. Especially for scientific purposes flexible solutions allowing easy data interchange are of major importance. Meta-information needs to be stored in addition to the actual data to allow later interpretation of the values. This highlights the demand for using standards in providing both the data and the data description. This contribution describes a data management approach developed at Graz University of Technology based on long term experience in sewer monitoring. It is based on the principles to use and refine existing open source technologies and use standards wherever possible in order to provide sustainable technologies adequate for the future challenges. A review of existing technologies shows that many commercial software solutions do not take the complexity of the scientific workflow fully into account. Relational database showed limited performance with high data volumes. Scientific data formats that provide proper means of data and metadata storage were most adequate. The presented solution is highly flexible and shows high performance. We hope that this contribution helps to promote scientific data formats and the use of standards. By this, the community will be prepared when these standards are more commonly used.},
