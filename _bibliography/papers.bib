abstract = {The hydraulic verification of combined sewer systems as well as the assessment of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) can be conducted using a hydrodynamic model. Unfortunately, long-term simulations with hydrodynamic models for the assessment of CSOs can cause unacceptably long computation times. Using only a series of storm events instead of a precipitation continuum can reduce this time and enables parallel simulation of single storm events. We introduce a method to select this series of storm events. The method's parameters have been optimized to replicate the overflow volume of the continuous simulation and to minimize the overall computation time. This optimization revealed a generally applicable parameter set that results in series of storm events that are shorter than the precipitation continuum by 86.2â€“95.2{\%} for the investigated cases. Additionally, the deviation of overflow volume between continuous simulation and series simulation ranges between only 0.1{\%} and 4.1{\%}.},

abstract = {In this paper we compare 6 algorithms for optimal pressure sensor placement by applying them to a real world system. The targets of these comparisons were a) to see how robust sensor positions are in terms of different mathematical approaches b) to derive the optimal sensor placement for the purpose of small leakage localisation in a case study distribution system. Therefore, we created artificial leakage scenarios in the real world system by opening fire hydrants at different flow rates. Pressure was measured at all hydrants that were found to be an ideal sensor position by any of the applied methods. Based on these measurements, model-based leakage localization was run using data from the different sensor sets. To compare leakage localization performance the distance between the found to the real world leak was calculated. The results of the sensor placement have shown similarities in sensor positions for graph theory based methods, but the ideal sensor positions derived from the sensitivity based methods varied strongly. The localisation results have shown that leaks down to 0.5 l/s can be located but for different leak positions different sensor sets, mainly those with sensors close to the leak position, led to the best performance.},

abstract = {While background leakages accounting for substantial water losses in supply networks remain unde- tectable, human reaction to even visible pipe bursts is insufficiently slow. We lose precious time in which not only water losses but severe damage to the surrounding infrastructure could be prevented. These leakages can often be identified only during the minimum night flow and so repair work is delayed by days, causing intermittent water supply and outages. Increasing costs and the importance to ensure supply security require further measures. Therefore, the application of holistic algorithms controlling proportional valves and pumps allows to act instantaneously on failures by isolating affected pipe sections and by reducing the pressure in that region. With the target to apply classical control theory and yet avoid too complex formulations, this paper presents a dynamic model using no more parameters than a typical, steady-state EPANET model. By means of a sophisticated network description, we modify the rigid water column theory in terms of pressure-driven demands. Other than traditional methods, this approach enables nodal consumptions to dynamically change inner system states such as pressure or flow values. Within this method, the nodal elevation undergoes proper treatment in the model equations and further ensures that pressure values will not become negative as one may have experienced in EPANET.},

abstract = {The calculation of outflow from pipe bursts is of interest for water utilities, as the discharged water may cause large amounts of damage to the adjacent infrastructure. Therefore, the crack type specific relationship between leakage outflow and pressure is of interest. Recent findings offer new opportunities for burst outflow calculations with hydraulic models. In this paper, we compare two calculation approaches according to uncertainties caused by input parameters and give recommendations for the applicability of the methods. Simulations in a case study area have shown large leakage outflow differences between the two approaches for longitudinal cracks. For circumferential cracks, the differences are smaller. Further, due to the uncertain leak size and form of probable bursts we involved Monte Carlo simulations in the model approach. These allow the derivation of mean values and standard deviations of leakage outflow per pipe section to make the uncertainty of the results more transparent.},

abstract = {Exchange of scientific data and metadata between single users or organizations is a challenging task due to differences in data formats, the genesis of data collection, ontologies and prior knowledge of the users. Different data storage requirements, mostly defined by the structure, size and access scenarios, require also different data storage solutions, since there is no and there cannot be a data format which is suitable for all tasks and needs that occur especially in a scientific workflow. Besides data, the generation and handling of additional corresponding metadata leads us to the additional challenge of defining the "meaning" of data, which should be formulated in a way that it can be commonly understood to get out a maximum of expected and shareable information of the observed processes. In our domain we are able to take advantage of standards defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium, namely the standards defined by the Sensor Web Enablement, WaterML and CF-NetCDF working groups. Even though these standards are freely available and some of them are commonly used in specialized software packages, the adaption in widespread end-user software solutions still seems to be in its beginnings. This contribution describes a software solution developed at Graz University of Technology, which targets the storage and exchange of measurement data with a special focus on meteorological, water quantity and water quality observation data collected within the last three decades. The solution was planned on basis of long-term experience in sewer monitoring and was built on top of open-source software only. It allows high-performance storage of time series and associated metadata, access-controlled web services for programmatic access, validation tasks, event detection, automated alerting and notification. An additional web-based graphical user interface was created which gives full control to end-users. The OpenSDM software approach makes it easier for measurement station operators, maintainers and end-users to take advantage of the standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium, which usage should be promoted in the water related communities.},

abstract = {To increase the performance, quality and reliability of water distribution systems, implementing efficient computational and algorithmic techniques, has become a major tasks in hydraulic modelling. Examples can be found in online condition monitoring, real time control applications, or model based leakage detection and location approaches, etc. All these techniques require extensive hydraulic simulations. Well known and trusted hydraulic simulation tools like EPANET, etc. are deployed within the individual task specific code using provided interface routines. The flow dependent friction models of hydraulic systems require an iterative solution strategy to solve the problem. Although this is done efficiently using Newton-Raphson methods, the simulation output provided by those tools is limited to raw information (i.e. flow and head). Yet the superior algorithms often require more information than the raw output. I.e. gradient based optimization methods rely on derivative information. In this paper we report on a hydraulic small signal model which can be directly derived from the output of the hydraulic simulation tool itself. The model provides cheap computational access to internal information like gradients, sensitivity, etc. of the hydraulic simulation. The ATCA equilibrium structure of the model is numerically suitable and provides properties like a positive definite stiffness matrix enabling the efficient use of direct solvers like Cholesky decomposition. Further, the symmetry provides the property of self adjointness which enables the efficient use of Greens functions. We will present how the model can be assembled from the raw simulator output and present how to use it as linear approximation, for the computation of search directions in gradient based optimization schemes, for sensitivity analysis, as well as for the computation of covariance propagation due to uncertain demands.},

This highlights the demand for using standards in providing both the data and the data description. This contribution describes a data management approach developed at Graz University of Technology based on long term experience in sewer monitoring. It is based on the principles to use and refine existing open source technologies and use standards wherever possible in order to provide sustainable technologies adequate for the future challenges. A review of existing technologies shows that many commercial software solutions do not take the complexity of the scientific workflow fully into account. Relational database showed limited performance with high data volumes. Scientific data formats that provide proper means of data and metadata storage were most adequate. The presented solution is highly flexible and shows high performance. We hope that this contribution helps to promote scientific data formats and the use of standards.
